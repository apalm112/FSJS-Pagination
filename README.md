# FSJS Project #2: Pagination-Content-Filter

Project to implement a pagination feature & a content filter for a web page which contains a listing of students.

The script uses unobtrusive JavaScript to append markup for the pagination links and content filter.  If a browser has JS disabled, then the entire student list is shown on the initial page load.

The pagination links and search results are calculated for any number of students in the HTML.  The user can click through the listing or search for a specific student.


Script is deployed at https://apalm112.github.io/FSJS-Pagination/
